# Getting Memory-bound Kernels to Speed-of-Light
Wentao Guo, Ted Zadouri, Tri Dao

To make GPUs go brrr for both model training and inference, one has to optimize both compute-bound kernels (e.g. matmul, attention) and memory-bound kernels (pretty much everything else, such as elementwise, normalization, loss). [Matmul](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/) and [attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main) are already some of the most heavily optimized subroutines that we have. Here we instead focus on memory-bound kernels, where most of the time is spent on memory access (IO) instead of on actual computation. By understanding and exploiting the thread and memory hierarchy on modern accelerators, we can get these kernels to close to speed-of-light (as fast as theoretically possible). Thanks to the recent [CuTe-DSL](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/pythonDSL/cute_dsl_general/dsl_introduction.html), we can do so right in the comfort of an ergonomic Python environment, without having to touch CUDA C or C++.

For memory-bound kernels, the ratio between the number of Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) consumed and the number of bytes transferred is small (such ratio is called Arithmetic Intensity). Once a kernel‚Äôs arithmetic intensity enters the memory-bound regime, the kernel's throughput is determined by how many bytes/second the kernel can deliver rather than by FLOPs/second the kernel computes.

Within the memory-bound kernels, elementwise activation is usually easier to deal with ‚Äî it is inherently perfectly parallel as there are no dependencies across the elements. However, reduction operations are also prevalent in DL operators such as softmax and RMSNorm, and they require an aggregation of all values. A parallel associative reduction algorithm will execute O(log(#reduced dim)) rounds of partial reduction across threads in different spatiality where our knowledge of GPU memory hierarchy would help.

In this blogpost, we describe how we can leverage the GPU memory hierarchy to implement efficient reduction kernels. As an example, we use CuTe DSL to implement 3 commonly used kernels in Large Language Models: RMSNorm, softmax, and cross entropy loss. We want to hit the maximum hardware throughput, or ‚ÄúGPU speed-of-light throughput‚Äù, and we need 2 ingredients: (1) global memory coalesce load/store (2) hardware-aware reduction strategy. As a bonus, we‚Äôll also explain cluster reduction, a relatively new feature on Nvidia GPUs starting with Hopper (H100), and how that helps with very large reductions. This blogpost will explain the details of these ingredients and flesh out how they allow us to write speed-of-light kernels. Let‚Äôs start our journey!

## GPU Memory Hierarchy

Before we start to write the kernel code, we should first understand the modern GPU memory hierarchy. For now let‚Äôs focus on Hopper architecture GPU (e.g. H100) as an example.

On Hopper GPUs, the CUDA execution hierarchy now spans four tiers: **threads**, **thread blocks**, the new **thread block cluster**, and the full grid. Individual threads are executed in groups of **32-lane (each lane being a thread) warps** inside a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM); each thread block enjoys a unified 192-256 KB shared memory (SMEM) that all warps within the same thread block have access. H100‚Äôs thread cluster allows up to 16 thread blocks running on neighboring SMs to read, write, and perform atomics in one another‚Äôs shared memory via the Distributed Shared Memory (DSMEM) fabric. This is coordinated via low-latency cluster barriers and thus avoiding costly global-memory round-trips.

Every tier of memory has a read & write primitive available for local reduction. We will therefore develop a general reduction template in CuTe DSL and achieve speed-of-light throughput on H100 consistently across reduction dimensions from 256 to 262k.

Hopper GPU‚Äôs Execution Granularity Meets Memory Hierarchy
| Execution Granularity       | Operating Memory              | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Threads                    | Registers (1st memory tier)    | Each thread can own up to 255 registers.                                                                                                              |
| Warps                      | Registers (1st memory tier)    | Each warp has 32 consecutive threads, and it is the smallest parallel execution unit. Within the same warp, each thread can fetch registers owned by other threads via warp shuffle. |
| Thread Blocks              | Shared Memory (2nd memory tier)| Each thread block can contain up to 1024 threads or 16 warps. All threads within each thread block are executed on the same SM and can read/write to the same shared memory.          |
| Thread Block Clusters      | Distributed Shared Memory (3rd memory tier) | Neighboring (up to 16) thread blocks can read and write to others‚Äô shared memory via a dedicated SM-to-SM network. This abstraction is ‚Äúdistributed shared memory‚Äù. |
| Grids                      | Global Memory                  | All threads within the same kernel can read and write to the global memory.                                                                          |

Each memory tier has distinct memory access latency and bandwidth. For example, it usually takes a few ns to access thread-owned registers, and ~10-20 ns for accessing shared memory. We will then see a significant jump in latency for L2 (~150-200 ns), and finally ~400ns for accessing DRAM. Similarly, for device-wide bandwidth, we usually observe >100 TB/s for accessing registers, ~20-30 TB/s for accessing SMEM, ~5-10 TB/s for accessing L2, and for memory-bound kernel, H100 HBM3‚Äôs 3.35 TB/s throughput is usually the bottleneck. To fully utilize our hardware, we should design our memory-bound kernels following the memory hierarchy: we preferably allocate most local reduction on higher memory level, and only forward on the small amount of locally-reduced values to the next memory level. Chris Fleetwood has a similar illustration on the latency of memory access in A100 (without thread block cluster) in his [blogpost](https://fleetwood.dev/posts/domain-specific-architectures) [3], and H100 adds an extra memory hierarchy abstraction between SMEM and GMEM.
